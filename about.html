									<h1>About</h1>
								</header>
								<p style="font-size: 0.93rem;"><span class="image left"><img src="images/Formal_Picture1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>I am a Mechanical Engineer who is passionate about the technology and its advancment throughtout the years. I am intersted in the design field where I can bring forth my creative side to life with prominent designs and mechanisms that serves fascinating purposes. I believe that a talented designer is not only capable, but also has the unlimited potential to bring extraordinary ideas to life.</p>
								<p style="font-size: 0.93rem;">However, in a world where purely mechanical systems cease to exist, one must go off the beaten track to produce modern designs. The power that programable mechanisms possess is impeccable but also at the same time challanging. However, as a mechanical engineer, I have faced loads of challanges regarding the mechatronics field and have been successful at leaping beyond them.</p>
								<p style="font-size: 0.93rem;">Taking this into consideration, I have been enhancing my expertise and building a rigid base in both the design and the automation fields. I have face many barriers througout my journey which through my presistance and hard-work was I capable of overcoming them.</p>
								<p style="font-size: 0.93rem;">With that being said, I am showcasing some of the projects that I have worked on during my career and academic journey. Check out my latests work and do not hesitate to contact me for any inquiry. </p>
