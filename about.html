									<h1>About</h1>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Formal_Picture1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>I have always been fascinated by the engineering world and the way it has made life easier for human beings. The engineering field has been expanding rapidly over the years. This advancement has been made possible through driven and diligent engineers all over the world.</p>
								<p>Inspired by the technology that has provided us with the world we live in, I have pursued a major in Mechanical Engineering. Throughout this academic journey, I have learned about a plethora of concepts and information that have set me on track to set foot in the engineering world.</p>
								<p>From the beginning, my career journey has been anything but facile. However, I have had the chance to gain experience in several mechanical engineering fields, which has provided me with general knowledge in each field. I have gained experience in the automotive, control, design, and construction industries and believe that each is just as interesting.</p>
								<p>I am currently working in a Consulting and Contracting firm whom are considered experts in the field. I am ready to receive any consultation and inquiry regarding my area of expertise. I am looking forward to providing you with the information you need.</p>
